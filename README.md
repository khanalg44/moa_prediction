# Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction


[Kaggle Cometetion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/data)

In order to maintain consistency, please download all the datafiles from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/data) and put them in a local deirectory `datasets`.

I didn't push the data to git as the file size was too big (~300MB).

 Also if you don't want to push your `datasets` directory, create a file `.gitignore` and put `datasets` in that file that will force Git to ignore that directory
